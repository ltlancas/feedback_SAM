# feedback_SAM
This repository contains a series of models for the evolution of star forming clouds and
the feedback bubbles from massive star feedback that regulate that star formation. This
code is under active development. The iPython notebook `walkthrough.ipynb` contains an
explanation of parts of the code that may be useful to users.

Some details on each of the clases implemented here are provided on the home page of the
Wiki.
